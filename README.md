# Claude Semaphore 🚦

A tiny macOS **menu bar traffic light** for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). See at a glance whether Claude is working, done, or waiting for you — without keeping the terminal in focus.

| Menu bar | State | When |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Claude finished | done | Claude finished responding |
| ⌛️/⏳ Claude working | working | Claude is thinking / running tools (the hourglass flips) |
| ‼️ Claude needs you | waiting | Claude is asking for your confirmation |

On **finished** and **needs you** it also plays a sound and posts a macOS notification. **Working** is silent on purpose (it fires constantly).

> **Status:** beta, macOS only. Linux/Windows are on the roadmap — PRs welcome.

## How it works

Two halves talk through a tiny state file:

```
Claude Code ──(hooks)──▶ ~/.claude-semaphore/state ──(polling)──▶ menu bar app
```

- **The brain — hooks.** Claude Code [hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) write a word (`WORKING` / `WAITING` / `DONE`) to the state file on each event. This part is plain `printf`, so it's fully portable.
- **The face — `main.py`.** A [`rumps`](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps) menu bar app polls the file and updates the icon, plays sounds and posts notifications.

**Detecting "needs you" without a dedicated event.** Claude Code's `Notification` hook does not fire for permission prompts while the terminal is focused. So instead: every tool fires `PreToolUse` (→ `WAITING`) and, when it finishes, `PostToolUse` (→ `WORKING`). A tool that runs on its own flips back in milliseconds; a tool that waits for your confirmation stays in `WAITING`. A short **debounce** filters the fast blips so only a real wait turns the icon red.

**No moving text.** The working animation swaps only the emoji (⌛️ ↔ ⏳). Both emojis are the same width, so the label next to it never shifts.

**Anti-stuck.** If you cancel Claude with `Escape`, no hook fires and the state would stay `WORKING` forever — so a `WORKING` state that hasn't changed in `stale_seconds` auto-resets to `DONE`.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/claude-semaphore.git
cd claude-semaphore
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. Creates `~/.claude-semaphore/` with its own Python venv + `rumps`.
2. Copies `main.py` and creates `config.json` (an existing one is respected).
3. **Safely merges** the hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` — it backs the file up first and never overwrites your existing settings (idempotent: re-running won't duplicate).
4. Installs a LaunchAgent so the app starts at login, and launches it now.
5. Drops a `Claude Semaphore.app` into `~/Applications` so you can [reopen it manually](#reopening-it-manually) from Spotlight/Finder.

**Then restart Claude Code** so it picks up the hooks (accept the hook-review prompt if it appears).

## Menu

Click the icon:

- **Notifications** — toggle the macOS notifications.
- **Play sounds** — master switch for all sounds.
- **Sound per state** — pick the sound for each state (**Finished** / **Working** / **Needs you**) from the macOS system sounds, or **None**. It previews the sound as you pick it and remembers your choice across restarts (overriding `config.json`).
- **Restart (hard reset)** — clears the state and relaunches the process if anything gets stuck.
- **Quit Claude Semaphore**.

Both toggles persist across restarts.

### Reopening it manually

Quit the app (or it isn't running)? The installer drops a **`Claude Semaphore.app`** into `~/Applications`, so you can reopen it like any other app — search "Claude Semaphore" in **Spotlight** (⌘Space), or double-click it in Finder / Launchpad. It just wakes the background agent back up (and does nothing if it's already running).

Prefer the terminal? `launchctl kickstart gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-semaphore.agent` does the same thing.

## Configure

Everything visible lives in `~/.claude-semaphore/config.json` (see [`config.example.json`](config/config.example.json)):

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `states.*.icon` / `.label` | emoji + text per state |
| `states.*.sound` | a `/System/Library/Sounds` name (e.g. `Glass.aiff`), an absolute path, or `null` |
| `states.*.notify` | whether that state posts a notification |
| `cooking_frames` | the emojis the "working" state alternates through |
| `poll_seconds` | how often the state file is read |
| `red_debounce_seconds` | how long `WAITING` must persist to count as a real wait |
| `anim_seconds` | animation speed |
| `stale_seconds` | idle `WORKING` time before auto-resetting to done |
| `show_elapsed` | append an elapsed timer while working (note: may slightly shift the text) |

Edit it, then **Restart (hard reset)** from the menu.

---

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Removes the LaunchAgent and the `Claude Semaphore.app`, and cleanly strips only *its own* hooks from `settings.json` (with a backup). It asks before deleting `~/.claude-semaphore/`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Icon doesn't appear** → check `/tmp/claude-semaphore.err.log`.
- **Never turns red / "needs you"** → you're in *bypass permissions* mode (Claude auto-approves everything, so it never asks). Exit it with `Shift+Tab`.
- **Stuck after cancel (Escape)** → expected briefly; the anti-stuck reset returns it to ✅ after `stale_seconds`. Use **Restart (hard reset)** to skip the wait.
- **Changed hooks and nothing happens** → restart the Claude Code session.

---

## Roadmap

- 🐧🪟 Linux (`pystray` + `notify-send`) and Windows support
- 🍎 `.app` bundle / Homebrew formula (install without Python)
- 🖱️ Click to focus the Claude window
- 🧵 Multi-session awareness (today a single global state file is shared across sessions)

Contributions welcome!
